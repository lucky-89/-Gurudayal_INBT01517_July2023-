This repositorty was created for the iNeuBytes Virtual Internship programm [July2023].In this virtual internship programm i learned many things like making product based portfolio and working with API fetching and setting the API in our project and also know the cloning of any website.
I understand that the clone-based project created by me is intended solely for educational purposes.
